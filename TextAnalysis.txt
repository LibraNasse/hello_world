 PARSER
 parser is a software component that takes input data (frequently text) and builds a data structure – 
 often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree or other hierarchical structure – giving a structural representation of the input, 
 hecking for correct syntax in the process.
 
 LEXICAL ANALYSIS
 In computer science, lexical analysis is the process of converting a sequence of characters (such as in a computer program or web page)
 into a sequence of tokens (strings with an assigned and thus identified meaning). A program that performs lexical analysis may be termed a lexer, tokenizer,[1] or scanner, though scanner is also a term for the first stage of a lexer. 
 A lexer is generally combined with a parser, which together analyze the syntax of programming languages, web pages, and so forth.
