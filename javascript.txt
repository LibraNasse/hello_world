Javascript: 
Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Webcontent production; 
the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern Web browsers without plug-ins.

JavaScript is also used in environments that are not Web-based, 
such as PDF documents, site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets. 

...also for server-side Web applications.

 It is also used in game development, the creation of desktop and mobile applications, 
and server-side network programming with run-time environments such as Node.js.

The most common use of JavaScript is to add client-side behavior to HTML pages, a.k.a. Dynamic HTML (DHTML). 
Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML pages and interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of the page.

Because JavaScript code can run locally in a user's browser (rather than on a remote server), 
the browser can respond to user actions quickly, making an application more responsive.
Furthermore, JavaScript code can detect user actions that HTML alone cannot, such as individual keystrokes.
Applications such as Gmail take advantage of this: much of the user-interface logic is written in JavaScript, 
and JavaScript dispatches requests for information (such as the content of an e-mail message) to the server. 
The wider trend of Ajax programming similarly exploits this strength.

A Web browser is by far the most common host environment for JavaScript. 
Web browsers typically create "host objects" to represent the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript. 
The Web server is another common host environment.
A JavaScript Web server would typically expose host objects representing HTTP request and response objects, 
which a JavaScript program could then interrogate and manipulate to dynamically generate Web pages.

ECMAScript = ES:
ECMAScript is a Standard for scripting languages.
Languages like Javascript are based on the ECMAScript standard.
ECMA Standard is based on several originating technologies, the most well known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft).
ECMA means European Computer Manufacturerâ€™s Association

JavaScript = JS:
JavaScript is the most popular implementations of the ECMAScript Standard.
The core features of Javascript are based on the ECMAScript standard,  but Javascript also has other additional features that are not in the ECMA specifications/standard.
ActionScript and JScript are another languages that implements the ECMAScript.
JavaScript was submitted to ECMA for standardization but due to trademark issues with the name Javascript the standard became called ECMAScript.
Every browser has a JavaScript interpreter.

ES6 = ECMAScript 6 = ES2015 = ECMAScript 2015:
ES2015 is a version of the ECMAScript (new/future one).
Officially the name ES2015 should be used instead of ES6.
ES6 will tackle many of the core language shortcomings addressed in  TypeScript and CoffeeScript.
ES6 is the next iteration of JavaScript, but it does not run in today's browsers.
There are quite a few transpilers that will export ES5 for running in browsers.
