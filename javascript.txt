Javascript: 
Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Webcontent production; 
the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern Web browsers without plug-ins.

JavaScript is also used in environments that are not Web-based, 
such as PDF documents, site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets. 

...also for server-side Web applications.

 It is also used in game development, the creation of desktop and mobile applications, 
and server-side network programming with run-time environments such as Node.js.

The most common use of JavaScript is to add client-side behavior to HTML pages, a.k.a. Dynamic HTML (DHTML). 
Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML pages and interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of the page.

Because JavaScript code can run locally in a user's browser (rather than on a remote server), 
the browser can respond to user actions quickly, making an application more responsive.
Furthermore, JavaScript code can detect user actions that HTML alone cannot, such as individual keystrokes.
Applications such as Gmail take advantage of this: much of the user-interface logic is written in JavaScript, 
and JavaScript dispatches requests for information (such as the content of an e-mail message) to the server. 
The wider trend of Ajax programming similarly exploits this strength.

A Web browser is by far the most common host environment for JavaScript. 
Web browsers typically create "host objects" to represent the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript. 
The Web server is another common host environment.
A JavaScript Web server would typically expose host objects representing HTTP request and response objects, 
which a JavaScript program could then interrogate and manipulate to dynamically generate Web pages.
