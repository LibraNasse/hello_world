What is XAML?
Extensible Application Markup Language, or XAML (pronounced "zammel"), is an XML-based markup language developed by Microsoft. 
XAML is the language behind the visual presentation of an application that you develop in Microsoft Expression Blend, 
just as HTML is the language behind the visual presentation of a Web page. 
Creating an application in Expression Blend means writing XAML code, either by hand or visually by working in theDesign view of Expression Blend.


The relationship between XAML and code-behind files
The XAML for any given document in Expression Blend is stored in a .xaml file. 
If there is underlying code for your XAML document, that code is stored in a file of the same name, 
with the additional extension of .cs or .vb. For example, if your XAML document is named Window1.xaml, 
the code-behind file will be called Window1.xaml.cs if the programming language of the code is C#.
